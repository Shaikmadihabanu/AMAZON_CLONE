# AMAZON_CLONE
ðŸŒŸ Amazon Clone Project ðŸŒŸ I built this Amazon Clone in just 4-5 hours using HTML and CSS. This project was a fun way to practice web development skills, focusing on layout design and styling.  Currently, itâ€™s a static version, but I plan to add interactive features like JavaScript functionality and dynamic content in the future.
